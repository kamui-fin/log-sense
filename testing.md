- LogGPT Minio model training, updates, and loading. Test on a small amount of data first, then on full BGL.
  - Might need to introduce manual trigger functionality, even if debug-only
  - Check if Tensorboard is recording train progress
- RAPID train mode, volume handling. Train up a BGL and see how it performs
    - Switch off logs while testing for throughput
- Inference tests on both models. Make sure it lines up with expected F1 scores
- Check if UI-side grafana contextualization still works
- Test for fault-tolerance by killing kafka, mongo, minio etc
- Make sure the hyperparameter config is actually being applied properly
- With pre-initialized models, test from promtail sources. Try to get a convincing demo out of this
